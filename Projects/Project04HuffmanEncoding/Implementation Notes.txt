- buildDict method: 
buildDict adds a huffman encoding entry into the 'huffmandict'
encoding dictionary / table. It pairs a character (key) and the
associated huffman encoded 'bit' string (value) (ex. '1001') 

- visitAllSubnodes method: 
visitAllSubnodes traverses through the tree in inorder fashion
and uses the buildDict method to add each leaf in the huffman
encoding dictionary / table called 'huffmandict' in the program

- delMin method: 
The delMin method has been modified to return the tuple from 
the heapArray instead of just the value of a tuple in the form
(key, value). This is used in the HuffmanEncoding algorithm for 
the purpose of determining the frequency, as the frequency of 
a character is represented by the key in the tuple.
